## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me enforce my knowledge and understanding of state and I generally became a lot more comfortable with react Js. Also it was my first project built with tailwind css so I learned a lot of tailwind too.

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to build the drag and drop feature, so this is my next challenge

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Site](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to find all the tailwind syntax I needed to style my project
- [Gradient border with tailwind css](https://dev.to/raivikas/how-to-create-a-gradient-border-blogpostcard-using-tailwind-css-and-nextjs-57fa) - This is an amazing article which helped me make a gradient border for the checkmarks in the todo elements
